## Rules

### Your Goal  
Click on unique cards without repeating any.

### Each Click  
- If you click on a new card – you get a point.  
- If you click on a card you've already selected – the game resets (your score goes back to zero).

### After Each Click  
The cards are shuffled to make memorizing their positions harder.

### Victory  
Score the maximum number of unique clicks (20 points) without making a mistake.
